### General project requirements

The project should be implemented as a single-page application (SPA) with client-side routing (via browser's History API). Communication with remote data source has to be performed via AJAX.

Upon implementation, a showcased version of the project should be deployed and hosted via web-server (local or remote one).

The interface of the application has to be marked down via HTML (HTML version 5). The markup itself has to be semantically correct (e.g. <a> tag can be used for links, but not for buttons). Different page sections should utilize existing HTML5 tags to keep page division clear for developers (<nav>, <header>, <article>, ...).

Interface of the web-site must properly be displayed at least on following screens: 1440x900 (desktop) and your mobile device of choice. (You can use Chrome's emulator to test your site).

Styling solution for this project is plain CSS (or pre-processor of your choice: SCSS, Less). No third-party styling libraries (such as Bootstrap) are allowed by default.
